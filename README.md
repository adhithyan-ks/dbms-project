# dbms-project
This project implements a database application, called SPORTS DAY DATABASE SYSTEM, that keeps track of participants, departments, and sporting events. The Sports Day event involves various departments, with participants representing their respective departments. Each department has multiple participants, and the system tracks the sporting events (items) they register for. Each participant is allowed to compete in up to three items. The system is designed to efficiently manage all participant data, event information, and their relationships, using the open-source DBMS software MySQL.
